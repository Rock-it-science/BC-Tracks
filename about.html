BC Tracks works with municipalities throughout British Columbia to keep track of local wildlife sightings.
Users submit a report through the website which will mark the location of the sighting on a live web map using the geolocation feature on a mobile device.
When filing a report, there is an option to mark an animal as in distress or as a threat to public safety. When this information is disclosed on a report, a copy of the report is forwarded directly to the municipalityâ€™s email inbox for review.
Contact information can be optionally provided to receive a follow up once the report has been reviewed.

BC Tracks aims to provide BC residents and municipalities with a better understanding of wildlife populations in their area, whether it be to aid in locating the perfect spot for bird watching, to avoid dangerous wildlife encounters, or to assist in conservation efforts.
